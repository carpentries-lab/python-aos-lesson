# Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Scientists

This repository contains the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) lesson materials
for a single day workshop on using python (and git) in the atmosphere and ocean sciences:
[https://carpentries-lab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/)

The lessons are maintained and updated by the global community of qualified Carpentries
instructors who work/study in the atmosphere and ocean sciences (see below).
The lead maintainers are:
- [Damien Irving](https://damienirving.github.io/), @DamienIrving
- [Claire Trenham](https://people.csiro.au/T/C/claire-trenham), @hot007
- [Sarah Murphy](https://sarahymurphy.github.io/), @sarahymurphy

The lesson materials have been used in the following workshops and university courses:  
* Data Carpentry workshop at the 2022 ICSHMO conference, February 2022 (see [in-person](https://pletzer.github.io/2022-02-08-icshmo/) and [online](https://damienirving.github.io/2022-02-08-icshmo-online/) workshops)
* [AMS Python Short Course](https://damienirving.github.io/2021-03-02-ams/), March 2021 (see [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9E-Np_QpNVR2mdbnXLfd81-hmKk20sD))
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2021 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2021-02-04-amos/), February 2021 (access [video recording](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8206169) with password: AMOS_DCW2021)

* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2019 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2019-06-10-amos/), June 2019
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology](https://damienirving.github.io/2019-05-23-bom/), May 2019
* Changing Global Environments, 3rd year undergraduate subject, University of Wollongong, Semester 2, 2018
* [Data Carpentry workshop at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://damienirving.github.io/2018-08-15-whoi/), August 2018
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2018 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2018-02-04-amos-icshmo/), February 2018

An overview of the development of the lesson materials and plans for the future
was delivered during the Python Symposium at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the
American Meteorological Society
(see [video recording](https://ams.confex.com/ams/2020Annual/videogateway.cgi/id/521844?recordingid=521844)).

## Instructor community

Over the past few years,
research disciplines such as ecology and genomics have established large communities
of qualified [Carpentries instructors](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/).
These communities collaboratively contribute to the ongoing maintenance and development
of the Data Carpentry ecology and genomics lesson materials and have delivered
dozens of workshops around the world.

Now that an initial set of PyAOS lesson materials has been developed, tested and published,
the goal is to grow the PyAOS instructor community:
* [Damien Irving](https://damienirving.github.io/) (Climate Science Centre, CSRIO)
* [Claire Trenham](https://people.csiro.au/T/C/claire-trenham) (Climate Science Centre, CSIRO)
* [Sarah Murphy](https://sarahymurphy.github.io/) (Washington State University)
* [Holger Wolff](https://climateextremes.org.au/member-profile/?memberID=93) (ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, Monash University) 
* [Kathy Pegion](https://www.kathypegion.com/) (Department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Earth Sciences, George Mason University)
* [Elizabeth Dobbins](https://uaf.edu/cfos/people/research-staff-and-post-docs/detail/elizabeth-dobbins.php) (College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, University of Alaska Fairbanks)
* [Alma Castillo](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/a4castillotrujillo) (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego)
* [Romina Mezher](https://inta.gob.ar/personas/mezher.romina) (Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria)
